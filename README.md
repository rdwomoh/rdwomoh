- 👋 Hi, I’m @rdwomoh
- 👀 I'm interested in data analytics, machine learning, and web development.
- 🌱 I recently graduated from a Data Analytics And Visualization program with The School Of Continuing Studies(UOFT).
- 💞️ I'm looking to collaborate on data-driven projects that leverage my skills in data analytics and visualization. As a recent graduate from a data analytics and visualization bootcamp, I have gained hands-on experience in various data tools and techniques, including Python, SQL, Tableau, and data cleaning methods.

I'm enthusiastic about working on projects that involve data exploration, data cleaning, and generating insightful visualizations to extract meaningful insights. Whether it's analyzing business trends, performing market research, or tackling real-world challenges with data, I'm eager to contribute and learn from collaborative projects.

If you have any data-related projects where I could be of assistance, please don't hesitate to reach out. I'm open to opportunities for both personal growth and making a positive impact through data-driven solutions. You can contact me through my GitHub profile or via email at [robertdwomoh66@gmail.com].

Looking forward to connecting with fellow data enthusiasts and building something great together!

[Robert Osei Dwomoh]
